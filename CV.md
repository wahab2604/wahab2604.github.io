## Profile

Adaptable Ph.D. chemical engineer with a solid chemistry foundation and experience in both academic and commercial research environments. Experienced cement chemist with expertise in thermodynamic modeling, high-temperature synthesis, and mechanical testing. Combines strong research capabilities with practical industrial applications and projects. Proven track record in developing innovative cement solutions, managing research projects, and creating computational tools.

## Research Experience

### Principal Researcher
**Gulf Organisation for Research and Development, Doha, Qatar**
*May 2025 – Present*

- Lead cement chemist responsible for all cement activities at the institute internally and externally funded.
- Manage clinker synthesis lab and built a mechanical testing lab.
- Led development of AI-based process optimisation software for clinker production, currently in trial with Qatar National Cement Company.
- Synthesised and tested mortar samples containing a novel nanomaterial admixture, showing up to 30% improvement in mechanical strength.
- Created financial models for three spin-out technologies with corresponding pitch decks.
- Led and submitted proposals for calls from Qatar Research Development and Innovation Council.
- Managed onboarding of new researchers and delivered training in cement chemistry and characterization techniques.

### Post Doctoral Researcher
**Gulf Organisation for Research and Development, Doha, Qatar**
*May 2024 – May 2025*

- Contributed to large scale project funded by QRDI (~3M USD), developing a cost-effective CSA cement from materials provided by Qatar National Cement Company.
- Contributed to a Qatar-Spain project (~0.5M USD) - carried out DFT to screen metal complexes for gas-sensing applications.
- Synthesised and characterised low ye'elimite and reactive belite CSA clinkers using a novel sulfur combustion process.
- Produced cost competitive cement clinker at pilot scale (500 kg) using a novel production process – equivalent performance to Portland at 28 days with much lower GWP.
- Created thermodynamic tools for lab-scale optimisation and process optimisation.

### Post Doctoral Researcher
**University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK**
*Mar 2023 – Apr 2024*

- Contributed to large scale project funded by UKRI (~4M USD), developing the manufacture of BCSA cements from waste materials.
- Modelled new thermodynamic properties of main cement clinker phases, secondary phases, and the effect of impurities.
- Developed tools and techniques enabling quicker and more accurate prediction of final cement properties – leading to pilot trial producing 1 ton of material.
- Developed process models for CSA cement manufacture, including thermodynamic, kinetic and heat transfer effects.

### Doctoral Researcher
**University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK**
*Sep 2019 – Feb 2023*

- International project funded by Nanocem (industrial cement consortium) researching thermodynamics of Portland cement clinkers including minor elements.
- Applied the CALPHAD approach to assess thermodynamic properties of cement clinker phases including minor elements.
- Developed Python tools and novel modelling techniques for quicker and more accurate assessment of phase diagrams.
- Validated developed thermodynamic database and tools against real clinkers received from industry.
